# calculator
A lil proj I started a rly rly long time ago to practice JS and programming (no AI, obviously) via Odin.

Somehow, right at the end of 2025, a silly drunk me decided to finish the whole thing in one sit. So, here we are: a real mess of logic... but i had fun and it actually works as a simple calculator following these reqs: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

Happy new yaer!! (insted of waching fireworks/花火 i did this, what a nerd am i).
